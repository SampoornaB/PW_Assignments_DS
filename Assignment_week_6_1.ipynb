    "\n",
    "CREATE statement is used to create new objects in our data warehouse. The most common objects created with CREATE statements are tables, schemas, views and functions.\n",

    "### Use of DROP :-\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP statement in SQL is used to remove a component from a relational database management system(RDMS). DROP destroys objects like an existing databases, table, imdex, or view.\n",
